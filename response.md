- we expanded the discussion of the paper to discuss these tools and how their functionality compares to scbs
- e.g. none of them is designed find VMRs or DMRs
- furthermore, we demonstrate that MOFA+ is fully compatible with scbs, i.e. it can be used for dimensionality reduction of methylation matrices (%meth or residuals) and, when using VMRs, performs similar to iterative PCA while using less RAM at the cost of a longer runtime.

- Lukas: I'm re-visiting the Argelaguet scNMT-seq gastrulation data set for this question. We can use it as another benchmarking data set to distinguish cell types, but I will also check if we can distinguish embryonic developmental stages and not just cell type.

- we added the latest annotation of ENCODE candidate cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs) in our benchmarks
- these regions are indeed suitable to distinguish cell types, as they outperformed both 100kb tiles and promoter regions in out benchmarks and performed similarly to VMRs  
![image](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/f43be414-65f3-46ef-be93-bf0a5a83471d)

- however, due to the large number of annotated cCREs (~340k in mouse) the resulting methylation matrices occupied lots of RAM even in data sets of modest size and took longer to process than the ~60k detected VMRs  
![image](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/70c678a3-b2fd-4d38-b05c-57bbd2011f03)

- of course, it might not be necessary to use all cCREs to distinguish cell types. In fact, many dimensionality reduction tools such as MOFA+ recommend strict feature selection, i.e. the exclusion of genomic features with low seuqencing coverage. Thus, we obtained the ~60k cCREs with the greatest sequencing coverage and repeated the benchmarks on this reduced data set. As expected, this reduced runtime and RAM usage, but cell type distinction was compromised compared to the full set of cCREs or VMRs.

![image](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/9ea24835-689a-4cd5-977a-5908bc7df535)  
- thus, VMR detection might more computationally efficient, even when accounting for the additional VMR detection step
- its also kind of cool that our ~60k VMRs perform equally well to the ~340k cCREs which were identified by ENCODE, hundreds of sequencing data set, while we can just find equally informative regions in 1500 methylomes
- furthermore, VMR detection offers a data-driven approach for sc-methylome analysis that does not require any prior knowledge on the genomic regions that might be informative. While cCREs seem to be suitable to distinguish cell types, not all biological factors of interest might be detectible at cCREs. Furthermore, cCREs are only available for mouse and human.

- To address this valid question, we performed an additional parameter sweep of the step size parameter. This benchmark revealed that step sizes between 5bp and 200bp perform very similarly, while performance dropped when using a step size of 500bp or 1000bp.

- As a greater step size leads to faster runtime of the VMR detection algorithm, we thus increased the default step size from 10bp to 100bp. We thank the reviewer for their valuable suggestion.

- it's challenging to find a data set with ground truth cell type labels, i.e. cell type labels derived not from methylation data but from transcriptomic data, so currently we are a bit limited in our possibilities
- we include the gastrulation scNMT data set from Wolf Reiks lab

- how can low neighbor scores result in clear separability?
- UMAP is just for visualization, and of course reducing the whole complexity of the data set to 2D loses lots of detail. So its better to look at the underlying PC space.

To explore how our methods fare on smaller data sets, we performed our benchmarks on sub-sampled data sets, the smallest of which comprise only 100 cells.
Importantly, these sub-samples were processed completely independently, which means that the smoothed averages against which we later normalize were computed separately for data sets of various cell numbers.
These benchmarks show that cell types are indeed more difficult to assign for such small data sets, as indicated by the lower neighbor scores.
However, this is also true when using the average methylation % instead of the shrunken mean of the residuals as a measure of DNA methylation, suggesting that our method does not worsen performance, and in contrast it even increased performance when using 100kb tiles or promoter regions as features.

This is an excellent suggestion.
We imagine that using a fixed number of CpG sites instead of a fixed number of base pairs might indeed be more sensible, as this approach would prevent the evaluation of near-empty genomic windows, i.e. windows in genomic regions with little CpG density that might only contain one or two CpG sites.
Furthermore, the proposed approach would create smaller windows in CpG-dense areas, which would lead to a more fine-grained evaluation of CpG islands.
To put this suggestion to the test, we created a fork of the scbs package at https://github.com/LKremer/scbs/tree/adaptive_bandwidth where the sliding window used for VMR detection always comprises a fixed number of CpG sites.
Testing this approach on our own multi-omics data set, using 9 CpG sites per window, produced very promising results:
We found that VMRs detected with this approach led to a slightly better neighbor score (i.e. better cell type separation), as well as decreased runtime of the VMR detection procedure.
For now, we consider this implementation experimental as its currently lacking unittests as well as extensive benchmarks on multiple data sets.
Furthermore, there are some implementation details that we have not resolved yet:
Especially in smaller data sets with low coverage and/or few cells, there might be substantial gaps with zero coverage between individual CpG sites.
Does it nonetheless make sense to include adjacent CpG sites into one window, or should there be a maximum distance at which windows are broken into smaller pieces?
For now, we thus decided to stick to the "classic" sliding window approach, but if future benchmarks confirm the superiority of this approach we will update the scbs package accordingly.

VMRs coordinates are determined by merging overlapping genomic windows above a variance threshold (2% by default).
Although the variance is then re-calculated for the entire VMR, this value is not used for a secondary filtering step but only reported in the output file of `scbs scan`.
The rationale behind this is that we also want to report regions where the variance of individual windows briefly drops below the variance threshold - such as the one depicted in Fig. 2:  
![Fig_sliding](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/e8f68d28-806e-4a4a-be6f-5a4d05fde243)  
In this example, two of the 2kb windows in the center of the VMR are just barely below the variance threshold, but we nonetheless report the entire region because the 2kb windows above the threshold are 2kb wide and are thus able to "bridge the gap".
Similarly, in the scenario described by the reviewer, a VMR with two opposite trends would not be discarded as long as the individual 2kb windows are above the 2% variance threshold.
However, our data indicate that such regions are rather rare.
A closer look at the variances of all 2kb windows of the largest chromosome, as well as the variances of reported VMRs, shows that the majority of VMRs are above the 2% variance threshold (red line).  
![image](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/9bf7845a-e9cd-4887-8b32-3176ee8baeaa)  
As expected due to the two scenarios described above, the region-wide variance of some VMRs is slightly below the 2% window variance threshold.
However, these variances are still well above genome-wide background levels (blue line: average of all genomic windows), suggesting that cancellation of two opposing signals as described by the reviewer is not common.

It is true that our previous benchmarks did not allow us to distinguish the effects of the choice of dimensionality reduction technique (e.g. iterative PCA) from the choice of DNA methylation measure (average methylation % or shrunken means of the residuals).
To disentangle the influence of these analysis options, we refined our benchmarks by testing all possible combinations of the following choices:
- genomic features at which DNA methylation is quantified (100kb tiles, VMRs, promoters or ENCODE candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs))
- the measure used to quantify DNA methylation at these features (average methylation % or the shrunken mean of the residuals)
- dimensionality reduction methods (iterative PCA as proposed by us, lightly-imputed PCA on high-coverage features as proposed by Luo et al., or PCA with the missing values set to the column-mean (i.e. zero when using residuals) as suggested by this reviewer in comment [4])  
![image](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/f43be414-65f3-46ef-be93-bf0a5a83471d)

Based on these new results, we can now draw more detailed conclusions on the impact various choices of methods:
1. Using the shrunken means of the residuals over average methylation percentages provides the greatest benefit when quantifying promoters or 100kb tiles.
   The likely reason for this is that these regions are more heterogeneously methylated than VMRs or cCREs:
   100kb tiles are very large and thus each tile will comprise stretches of DNA with high and low methylation.
   Similarly, many promoter regions (here: TSSÂ±2kb) will comprise a lowly-methylated center region near the TSS, as well as more highly methylated promoter flanks.
   As the shrunken mean of the residuals is designed to account for this heterogeneity within a region (Fig. 1), it makes sense that we see the greatest benefit of their use when quantifying promoters or large tiles.
2. The use of iterative PCA over other PCA-variations constantly improved the ability to distinguish cell types.
   The main reason for this performance gain is that iterative PCA alleviates differences between low-quality and high-quality cells, as is clearly visible in these plots:
   [add plot here]
3. Overall, it is clearly visible that the most important choice is the set of genomic features to be quantified. Our results indicate that both VMRs and ENCODE cCREs are suitable for this task and offer good ability to distinguish cell types, although using cCREs requires more RAM and runtime.

This comment was addressed and illustrated in our response to the previous comment, where we show benchmarking results and exemplary plots of zero-imputed PCAs.

Yes, the 130 vs 58 cells used for DMR detection were split off from a larger data set (comprising 540 cells) and compared against each other, as is commonly done in scRNA-seq where users might select two cell clusters for differential gene expression testing.
To clarify, the DMR detection procedure does not use any VMR coordinates that were detected on the full data set, as DMR coordinates are newly discovered on the selected sub-data set.
However, as the reviewer rightly points out, the DMR detection uses the shrunken mean of the residuals as a measure of methylation, which in turn uses the smoothed average genomic methylation values for normalization.
These smoothed averages were indeed calculated on the full data set and not on the reduced set of 130 + 58 cells.
To assess whether this would affect DMR detection, we thus repeated the DMR analysis depicted in Fig. 6 on the 130 + 58 cells only, using smoothed genomic averages calculated on these cells only.
The obtained oligodendrocyte- and NSC-DMR sets are largely consistent with those obtained using smoothed averages obtained from the full data set.
For comparison, here is Fig. 6 from the manuscript (full data set) and Fig. 6 based on the reduced data set only:

All 540 cells (current manuscript version of the figure):  
![Fig_DMRs](https://github.com/LKremer/scbs-figures/assets/15158974/51287393-fba8-4e2f-a82f-6359a57ed985)  
130 + 58 cells only:

While the DMR lists obtained using both approaches are not 100% identical, the results are qualitatively similar and yield similar largely identical top 5 enriched GO terms.

L: Ok, here we have to discuss a bit and explain that we want to be able to detect DMRs of flexible size.
Calculating FDR for individual windows would work, but once we merge them the FDR of the entire region is unclear.  
Maybe its also worth demonstrating that DMR detection works even if we don't merge windows, so its not the window merging thats driving significance.
Without merging, we get some nice DMRs but all of them have the same width, of course, which doesn't make so much sense:

In response to this comment, we greatly expanded the scope of our benchmarks by including additional data sets as well as other sets of genomic regions.
Specifically, we added the following data sets: ...
Furthermore, as kindly suggested by this reviewer, we included the set of promoter regions (TSS Â± 2 kbp), as well as the latest release of human and mouse candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) published by the ENCODE consortium.  

Add a quick summary of our updated conclusions here:
- if you're working on human/mouse, cCREs also work nicely, but lead to hefty resource and time requirements on intermediate to big data sets.
- our proposed approach (VMR detection -> residuals) robustly worked across all tested data sets

Here we have to kindly explain the following:
- to assess performance of a given combination of analysis methods, we assess its ability to distinguish cell types (neighbor score)
- for this, we need ground-truth cell type labels
- in our own dataset, we also have the transcriptome of each cell, which we can use to infer ground-truth cell type labels
- most published data sets only have methylome information though, so we cant use them for benchmarking
- as the cell type labels published by Luo et al. are already based on CH methylation, we cannot use these labels as a ground truth for benchmarking the performance of our tool on CH-data
- nonetheless, to demonstrate that scbs can be used to quantify and explore CH-data, we performed a representative CH-methylation analysis on Luo's data (add a UMAP based on CH-data here)

We were unable to retrieve the cell type annotation and methylation report files for this particular data set, but as mentioned in a previous reply, we included X additional data sets from various tissues in our benchmarks.

L: I think they are underestimating the size of these data sets, and also how uncommon such huge data sets currently are.
Even the smaller 100k cell data set was stitched together from almost 40 separate experiments, and the analysis likely took months to complete...
Quantifying enhancers in this data set is not feasible for sure, the methylation matrix would be 110k cells x 340k regions.
We can try CpG (not CH) in genomic tiles and/or VMRs just as a proof of concept.
To show that we can work with CH meth, we should use the Luo data set.
